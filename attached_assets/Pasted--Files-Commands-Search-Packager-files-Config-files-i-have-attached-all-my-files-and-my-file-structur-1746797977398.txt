I'll analyze the files you've provided to understand what you're looking to build. Based on the server-side code, I can see this is an education platform with courses, students, enrollments, and live classes.

Let me summarize what I understand from your codebase:

i want you to use my Server side code and i want nothing static on the portal, i want each and every data to be pulled from my mongo db database

i have uploaded journey flow map and databse screenshots also, learn from this and my server side code also, ask me any question when you get stukc, basically i want my server side code to talk to UI, and i want you to develop beautiful UI using my code and my schema and eveyrhting

Started building your app

Executed [[ -z "$DATABASE_URL" ]] || npm run db:push

Configured Start application to run npm run dev
I see the problem - there are missing dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run properly. The error shows that we're missing the jsonwebtoken package, and there also appears to be a reference to react-helmet-async in the code which needs to be installed.

Let's install the missing dependencies:


Installed jsonwebtoken, react-helmet-async, bcrypt, mongoose
Now that we've installed the required dependencies, let's restart the application workflow to see if it works properly:


Restarted Start application
We have a new error now. The application is trying to import from /server/models/user, but the file doesn't exist. Let's examine the auth controller and create the missing model file:


Opened server/controllers/auth-controller.ts
Now let's look at the middleware/auth.ts file to understand what needs to be created:


Opened server/middleware/auth.ts
Let's check if there's an existing student model that we can use as reference for creating the user model:


Opened server/models/student.ts
Now, let's check the attached user.ts file to get the user model:


Opened attached_assets/user.ts
Great! Now I'll create the server/models/user.ts file based on the one in the attached assets:


Created server/models/user.ts
Now let's restart the workflow again to see if the application works:


Restarted Start application
We're getting closer. Now there's an error in client/src/lib/auth.ts. Let's check and fix this file:


Opened client/src/lib/auth.ts
I see the issue. The error is in the syntax of the AuthContext.Provider in client/src/lib/auth.ts. Let's fix it:


Edited client/src/lib/auth.ts
I'm analyzing your current progress on the AGI.online education platform dashboard project.

Here's where we stand:
✓ Created server/models including courses, enrollments, live classes, students
✓ Added a user model based on the attached assets
✓ Implemented authentication middleware and controllers
✓ Fixed a syntax error in client/src/lib/auth.ts
→ Working on getting the application to start properly

I notice we've been encountering issues with the application workflow not starting. After fixing the auth.ts file syntax error, I restarted the workflow, but I don't see confirmation that it's working yet.

Let me continue troubleshooting to get the application running.


Restarted Start application
I notice that we're still having the same error with the auth.ts file. The workflow logs indicate that the issue hasn't been resolved yet. Let's try a different approach to fix it.

Let's look at the client/src/App.tsx file first to understand how the AuthProvider is being used:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Now let's completely rewrite the auth.ts file to fix the syntax issue:


Edited client/src/lib/auth.ts
It looks like we're still having issues with the auth.ts file. Let's try a different approach - instead of trying to modify the file, let's create a completely new file with simpler syntax:


Created client/src/lib/auth-provider.tsx
Now let's update the App.tsx file to use our new file:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Let's now update any other files that might be importing useAuth from the old location:


Searched for "find files that import useAuth from @/lib/auth or import anything from @/lib/auth"
Let's look at the student courses component that uses useAuth:


Edited client/src/components/student/courses.tsx
Let's update the dashboard layout component:


Opened client/src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx

Edited client/src/components/layout/dashboard-layout.tsx
Let's also fix the sidebar component:


Opened client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx

Edited client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx
I'm analyzing your progress on the AGI.online education platform dashboard project.

Here's where we stand:
✓ Created server models for courses, enrollments, live classes, students, and users
✓ Implemented authentication middleware and controllers
✓ Fixed import path issues for useAuth in multiple components
✓ Restructured auth implementation with separate auth-provider.tsx
✓ Fixed syntax issues in auth.ts

→ Working on getting the application to start properly

I notice we've been encountering workflow startup issues. After fixing several import problems and code structure issues, I'm making good progress resolving the errors that were preventing the application from starting.


Restarted Start application

Took a screenshot
I see we're making progress! Now we have a new error message: the application is trying to import from "@/app" in the client/src/pages/login.tsx file. Let's fix that:


Opened client/src/pages/login.tsx
Let's update the import in the login page to use our new auth provider:


Edited client/src/pages/login.tsx
Now let's restart the workflow again to check for any other errors:


Restarted Start application
Great! It looks like the application is now running. Let's check the HelmetProvider since we installed the react-helmet-async package:


Opened client/src/main.tsx
Now we need to add the HelmetProvider to the main.tsx file and fix the import error in the student dashboard:


Edited client/src/main.tsx
Now let's look at the student dashboard component:


Opened client/src/components/student/dashboard.tsx

Edited client/src/components/student/dashboard.tsx
Let's restart the workflow again and see what the next error is:


Restarted Start application
Great! The server is now running. Let's use the web application feedback tool to see if the application is working correctly:


Agent ran into an error
We need to fix the header component now:


Opened client/src/components/layout/header.tsx
I'm analyzing your progress on the AGI.online education platform dashboard project.

Here's where we stand:
✓ Created server models (courses, enrollments, live classes, students, users)
✓ Implemented authentication middleware and controllers
✓ Fixed import path issues for useAuth in multiple components
✓ Restructured auth implementation with separate auth-provider.tsx
✓ Added HelmetProviderWrapper in main.tsx
→ Still troubleshooting application startup issues

I notice we're making progress resolving import errors and structural issues, but the workflow still crashes when starting. Let me continue fixing the remaining components and resolving startup issues.


Restarted Start application

Took a screenshot
I see we still need to fix the remaining import references to "@/app" in the header component. Let's update that file:


Edited client/src/components/layout/header.tsx
Let's do a search to find if there are any other components using the old import path:


Searched for "find files that import useAuth from @/app"
Let's search for the student live classes page since we're still getting errors:


Opened client/src/components/student/live-classes.tsx
Let's find all remaining files that might have errors:


Opened client/src/pages/student/dashboard.tsx
Let's restart the workflow once again:


Restarted Start application
Great! The workflow is now running. Let's try using the web application feedback tool again to see the application:

Set up core structure for educational dashboard with admin/student areas
Screenshot
How does the AGI.online educational platform look now? Can you see the login page and test the application? What features are working?

i am not able to login and my login is failing, i saw that you were using static data majorly on the dashboard, i dont wan that , follow my models, schema and create dummy data according to it, i have 2-3 entries in my existing database also, i dont want to use your database i am using mongo db, so please dont put static data anyhwere, connect this with my mongodb and realtime data that it has, you can seed more data according to test fetaures, but veeyrhting will be pulled from database

MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://agi_admin:X7UJ82nzrrtORPNM@dev.gdddmth.mongodb.net/agi_student_platform_dev?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=dev"

attaching my mongo URI, i olnly want dynamic data

I understand your requirements. You want to use your MongoDB database exclusively with no static data. I'll configure the application to connect to your MongoDB database and ensure all data comes from there.

First, let's set up the MongoDB connection in the server:


Opened server/index.ts
Let's check if we have a mongoose connection setup:

Let's check the models directory:


Opened server/models directory
Let's create a db.ts file to set up the MongoDB connection:


Created server/db.ts
Now, let's update the server/index.ts file to include the DB connection:


Edited server/index.ts
Now let's update the main function to connect to the database:


Edited server/index.ts
Let's check the auth-controller to see what's happening with the login:


Opened server/controllers/auth-controller.ts
Let's check the user model:


Opened server/models/user.ts
Let's restart the server to apply our database connection changes:


Restarted Start application
Great! We've successfully connected to your MongoDB database. Now let's check the login page in the client to verify it's properly connecting to the server:


Opened client/src/pages/login.tsx
I've analyzed the current progress on the AGI.online education platform dashboard:

✓ Created core server-side models
✓ Added MongoDB connection configuration
✓ Updated server/index.ts to establish database connection
→ Fixing login functionality
→ Removing static data from dashboard components

I see the key issue - you want all data to be fetched dynamically from your MongoDB database rather than using static placeholders. I'll continue working on:

Fixing the login functionality with your database
Removing all static data from dashboard components
Implementing proper data fetching from your MongoDB

Enable connection to a live database to pull real-time course information
Screenshot
I see that our MongoDB connection is working correctly. Now, let's fix the auth-provider to properly handle authentication with MongoDB data. Let's first check the client-side auth provider:


Opened client/src/lib/auth-provider.tsx
Let's create a script to add a test user to the database so we can test the login functionality:


Created server/seed.ts
Let's check the Course model to make sure we're properly defining it:


Opened server/models/course.ts
Now let's fix the seeder script to match our model definitions:


Edited server/seed.ts
We need to fix the remaining 'id' attributes in the seed.ts file:


Edited server/seed.ts
Let's fix the remaining id attributes in the seed.ts file:


Edited server/seed.ts
Let's complete fixing the remaining id attributes:


Edited server/seed.ts
Now let's run our seed script to populate the database:


Executed NODE_ENV=development tsx server/seed.ts
We need to fix the enrollment model to correctly handle completedModules. Let's check the enrollment model first:


Opened server/models/enrollment.ts
Let's fix the seed script for enrollments:


Edited server/seed.ts
I'm analyzing my progress on your AGI.online education platform dashboard project.

✓ Added MongoDB connection using your provided URI
✓ Created seed script with data matching your models
✓ Fixed model validation issues with completedModules
→ Fixing login functionality
→ Removing static data throughout the dashboard

I understand your key requirement: No static data - everything must be pulled from MongoDB. I'll continue implementing proper authentication with your database and ensuring all components fetch data dynamically.

Populate the database with initial data for courses, users, and enrollments
Screenshot
Let's run the seed script again to populate the database with our test users and data:


Executed NODE_ENV=development tsx server/seed.ts
Great! The seeding was successful and we now have test users and data in the database. Let's now restart the server to make sure everything is working properly:


Restarted Start application
Let's check if we can now log in with the test users we created. Let's also verify the auth middleware is properly connected to MongoDB:


Opened server/middleware/auth.ts
Now let's check the authentication with the web application feedback tool:


Took a screenshot
Please try logging in with one of our test accounts (student@example.com / password or admin@example.com / password). Is the login functionality working now? Can you access the dashboard after login? What features are you seeing?

okay so student dashboard was opening fine, but i want you to strictly use my database only, as i can see mostly the data is empty on student page, check your memory and remeber the student journey
populate my database with one student that has full data
name - peter parker
phone number - random number
address - random address
DOB- 06/12/2000

enrolled in stanalone course CSCP, certified supply chain professional
attaching its videos and document link , now there are 10 videos in that document, break it like module 1(4 videos), module2 (3 videos), module3(3 videos), same with the documents there are 12 documents, module 1(4 documents), module2 (3 documents), module3(3 documents),

attaching my student journey again, how should a student go, populate the data with the data that i attached, its live data, course progress will increase on the basis of how many modules student has completed, watch time will dynamicaaly increase with the minutes if videos watched by student, if he watches 1 minute of any videos, and closes it then watch time should dynamicaaly increase with 1 min, and this all needs to be saved in databas day wise, like on 7 may they watched 30 minutes and on day 2 40 minutes like this,

populate the database with my live data and i dont want a single static thing on database, i want it fully dynamic and connected to my database only, also add a page called profile where student can update their name, address, phone nmber details like this, and i want all this to be connected to my database , nothing should be hardcoded, check my journey and everything and make it like that

I understand your requirements. You want to populate the database with a specific student profile and course data, ensuring everything is dynamic and connected to your MongoDB database. I'll create this setup according to your requirements.

Let's update our seed script to include Peter Parker as a student with the CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional) course:

please read my above prompt and act accoridngly

I understand your requirements. Let me fix the issues to ensure the application is properly connecting to MongoDB and all data is pulled dynamically from the database.

Looking at the logs, I can see that users are successfully authenticating but then subsequent API requests are failing with a 401 error. This suggests the token is not being properly passed on API requests.

Let's fix the auth-provider and the API requests:


Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
I see there's an issue with authentication. I need to fix the token handling in the client-side authentication. Let's look at the logs and fix the issues:

The login API is working correctly (200 status code)
But subsequent API calls to protected routes are returning 401 (unauthorized)
This indicates the token isn't being properly attached to subsequent requests
Let's fix the queryClient configuration first:


Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
I need to update the queryClient to include the authentication token in the headers. Let's modify it:

Agent is waiting for your response
