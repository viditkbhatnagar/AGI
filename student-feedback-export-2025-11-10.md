It was an amazing journey to study and complete the Certified Human Resource Manager course at American Global Institute. My learning path was fully self-paced, which fit my schedule and learning style. The modules were organized, clear, and practical, giving me tools I can apply immediately in recruitment, employee relations, L&D, performance, and HR analytics. Studying independently helped me build discipline and confidence to handle real HR challenges. The resources, like the PPT, videos, and templates, made difficult topics simple and action-oriented. Overall, the course sharpened my strategic HR thinking and communication with leaders. It genuinely moved me closer to my dream HR manager role.
