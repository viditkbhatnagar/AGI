## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For Students
1. **Registration**: Phone number must be registered in LMS
2. **Quiz Taking**: Use exact course slugs and module numbers
3. **Session Management**: Complete quizzes within 30 minutes
4. **Answer Format**: Reply with numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) for multiple choice

### For Admins
1. **Monitoring**: Check bot status regularly
2. **Testing**: Use test message feature before important sessions
3. **Troubleshooting**: Refer to console logs for connection issues

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Bot Not Responding
```bash
# Check bot status
curl http://localhost:5002/api/whatsapp/status

# Check environment variable
echo $ENABLE_WHATSAPP_BOT

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

#### Student Not Found
- Verify phone number is registered in student profile
- Check phone number format (no country code, numbers only)
- Ensure student has active enrollment

#### Quiz Not Found
- Verify course slug is correct
- Check module index (starts from 0)
- Confirm quiz exists in database for that module

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by adding to `.env`:
```bash
DEBUG=whatsapp:*
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### WhatsApp Business API (Recommended)
For production, consider upgrading to WhatsApp Business API:

1. **Better Reliability**: Official API with guaranteed uptime
2. **Webhook Support**: More robust message handling
3. **Business Features**: Verified business account

### Environment Variables for Production
```bash
ENABLE_WHATSAPP_BOT=true
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_verify_token
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_id
```

### Scaling Considerations
- Quiz sessions stored in memory (consider Redis for multiple servers)
- Rate limiting may be needed for high volume
- Monitor WhatsApp API limits

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Possible Extensions
1. **Multimedia Support**: Send images, documents for visual questions
2. **Scheduled Reminders**: Notify students about pending quizzes
3. **Group Features**: Create study groups or class announcements
4. **AI Integration**: Add intelligent tutoring or help features
5. **Voice Messages**: Support for audio-based interactions
