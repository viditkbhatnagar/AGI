# Recordings Feature Implementation

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive recordings feature for both admin and student dashboards. This feature allows:

- **Admins**: Upload, manage, and organize course recordings
- **Students**: View and watch recordings from their enrolled courses

## 🚀 What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **New `recordings` table** with fields:
  - `id`, `course_slug`, `live_class_id` (optional)
  - `title`, `description`, `file_url`, `file_name`
  - `file_size`, `duration`, `module_index` (optional)
  - `uploaded_by`, `uploaded_at`, `is_visible`
  - Foreign key relationships to `courses`, `live_classes`, and `users`

### 2. Backend Implementation
- **Recording Controller** (`server/controllers/recording-controller.ts`)
  - File upload handling with Multer
  - CRUD operations for recordings
  - Access control (students only see recordings from enrolled courses)
  - File validation (video files only, 500MB limit)

- **API Routes** (`server/routes.ts`)
  - Admin routes: `/api/recordings/*`
  - Student routes: `/api/student/recordings/*`
  - Static file serving for uploaded recordings

- **Storage Interface** (`server/storage.ts`)
  - Added recording operations to storage interface
  - Student access based on course enrollments

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Admin Dashboard
- **Recordings Page** (`client/src/pages/admin/recordings.tsx`)
- **AdminRecordings Component** (`client/src/components/admin/recordings.tsx`)
  - Upload form with course/live class selection
  - Recordings management table
  - Edit/delete functionality
  - File validation and progress indicators

#### Student Dashboard  
- **Recordings Page** (`client/src/pages/student/recordings.tsx`)
- **StudentRecordings Component** (`client/src/components/student/recordings.tsx`)
  - Course-based filtering and search
  - Video player with HTML5 controls
  - Responsive card layout
  - Module and duration badges

#### Navigation
- Added "Recordings" menu items to both admin and student sidebars
- Updated main app routing to include new pages

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
The recordings collection will be automatically created when you run the seed file. No manual migration needed for MongoDB setup.

### 2. Dependencies
Required dependencies have been installed:
```bash
npm install multer @types/multer
```

### 3. File Storage Setup
Create the uploads directory:
```bash
mkdir -p uploads/recordings
```

### 4. Database Seeding
Sample recordings have been added to your existing seed file. The recordings will only be created if:
- No existing recordings are found (preserves your existing data)
- Admin user exists 
- Referenced courses exist

Run the seed file as usual:
```bash
npm run seed
# or
tsx server/seedDb.ts
```

### 5. Environment Variables
Ensure your MongoDB connection is properly configured in your environment. The seed file will use your existing MongoDB connection setup.

## 📝 Notes

- File uploads are stored in `uploads/recordings/` directory
- Recordings are automatically associated with user's enrollment status
- Hidden recordings won't appear in student view
- File cleanup happens automatically when recordings are deleted
- All video playback uses HTML5 video controls

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Features

The recordings feature seamlessly integrates with:
- **Course Management**: Recordings linked to existing courses
- **Live Classes**: Optional association with scheduled live classes
- **Student Enrollments**: Access control based on enrollment status
- **Authentication System**: Uses existing auth middleware
- **Permission System**: Respects admin/student role separation

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Database**: Make sure to run the migration before using the feature
2. **File Storage**: Ensure the uploads directory has proper write permissions
3. **Environment**: Set DATABASE_URL for proper database connection
4. **Testing**: Test file uploads with various video formats and sizes

The recordings feature is now fully integrated and ready to use! Students can access recordings from their enrolled courses, while admins have full control over uploading and managing the video content.
